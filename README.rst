ARTIQ (Advanced Real-Time Infrastructure for Quantum physics) is an open source
control system for laser-cooled trapped ion experiments. It is being developed for
the Ion Storage Group at NIST its applicability reaches beyond ion trapping.

The system features a high-level programming language that helps describing
complex experiments, which is compiled and executed on dedicated hardware with
nanosecond timing resolution and sub-microsecond latency.

Technologies employed include Python, Migen, MiSoC/mor1kx, LLVM and llvmpy.
